# Browninan Balls - A simple pygame based computer game

My first experience of game development using pygame module. To play the game, run the file 'balls.py' and then you can explore the games rules naturally.

Major learning while developing this program are as below:
* Object Oriented Programming: I have used various features of python as object oriented progamming.
* Physics Simulation: Since I have used my own collision detection system for the ball object, I learned a lot about basic physics simulation.
* Game Mechanics: Last, but not the least, I learned a lot about game mechanics such as: scoring, levels, game over and others.
